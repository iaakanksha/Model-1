# Salary Predictor

Welcome, Here is my first End-to-end Machine Learning Web application which is build using Flask technology and hosted on Heroku cloud platform. 
So basically what does this app do is very simple it takes only 3 inputs from user and based on that it predicts the salary of the employee.
